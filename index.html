I am a Masters student in Civil and Environmental Engineering, focusing Transportation Engineering at the Swanson School of Engineering, University of Pittsburgh. I am also working as a graduate student researcher in the same department. My research interests include transportation planning, bike-sharing, smart cities, sustainable mobility. 

Back in my country, Bangladesh, I have worked in different sectors of civil engineering for around five years after completing my bachelors from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology.

Born and raised in a small heaven, Netrokona, Bangladesh; I have moved to Pennsylvania in 2017. My wife, Sumaiya, is doing Ph.D. in Biological Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech.
